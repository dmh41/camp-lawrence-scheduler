Camp Lawrence Scheduler Progress Report

## CURRENT STATE
All data input/output has been successfully transfered to CSV format. This allows for better integration with the Direct Camp Knack Web app. Accuracy report is also complete, details which campers missed out on a preference as well as the 
preference(s) they missed. A percentage of preferences that were recieved by campers is included as well.

## NEXT STATE
Will re-format activity data input so user can specify the number of periods, period restrictions for each activity, and which cabins will have swimming each period. This will eliminate the hard code found in lines 81-106 of Schedule.java.
